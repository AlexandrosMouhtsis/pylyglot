Introduction:
============

Installation:
============

* Install dependencies.
* Copy the conf/99-devel.conf.sample file and rename it to 99-devel.conf. By default sqlite is configured to be the engine with a new development.db file.
* Create a po/ directory in the root directory of your checkout.
* Populate the newly created po/ directory with *.po files. Right now the parser expects that *.po files are named in the following format:
    packagename-branchname.po

NOTE: This will be changed so that the name of the package is parsed from the *.po header section!

* Create the original database:
    python manage.py syncdb
* Populate the database by parsing the *.po files:
    python manage.py populatedb
* Start the server:
    python manage.py runserver

Dependencies:
